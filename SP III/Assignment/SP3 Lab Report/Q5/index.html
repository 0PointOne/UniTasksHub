        <p>
            The biggest scoreline in the history of the <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> qualifiers – and indeed in the history of international football – was recorded on 11 April 2001, when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0.

            This legendary match also brought global renown for Archie Thompson, whose 13-goal haul set a new world record, which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single international match.

            And though the defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery been that it is now the subject of an acclaimed documentary, <em>‘Next Goal Wins’</em>, showing across the world.
